## Namespace

A container for variables & functions, typically to keep variables & functions with the same name seperate.

## Function overload

Functions with same name but different length of parameters. Not possible in JS, functions are objects

## First class functions

Functions are objects. Everything you can do with other types you can do with functions.
Assign them to variables, pass them around, create them on the fly.

Properties
- Name (optional, can be anonymous)
- Code - actual lines of code that has been written, invocable ()
- Custom - can attach properties to functions, just as with objects. 
    - myFunction.property = 'name'
