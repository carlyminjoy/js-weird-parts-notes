## Dynamic typing

You don't tell the engine what type of data a variable holds, the javascript engine figures it out while code is running.

### Primitive types

A type of data that represents a single value (not an object)

- undefined - lack of existence, set by js engine
- null - lack of existence, but can be set
- boolean - true/false
- number - floating point number
- string - sequence of characters
- symbol - es6, not fully supported in all browsers

## Operators

A special function that is syntactically written different. 

- Takes 2 parameters & returns 1 result
- infix notation: operator function sits between parameters `3 + 4` instead of `+(3, 4)`

### Operator precedence

Which operator function gets called first. Functions are called in order of precedence.

### Operator associativity

What order operator functions get called in: left-to-right or right-to-left, when functions have the same precedence.

## Coercion

Converting a value from one type to another.
